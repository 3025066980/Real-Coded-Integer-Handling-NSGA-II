# Real-Coded-Integer-Handling-NSGA-II
MultiObjective Optimization Non-Sorting Genetic Algorithm capable to solve Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Problems.

This Code is a modified versiÃ³n of free available Tamilselvi Selvaraj NSGA II Matlab Code capable to solve mixed-integer non-linear programming with constraints. Several benchmarks problems are solved using aforementioned algorithm including problems with integer variables.

Guideline:
Open "NSGA_II_Abril_Test.m" .
Select the "p" benchmark problem that you want (p=2 ---> ZDT1 problem).
RUN "NSGA_II_Abril_Test.m"
